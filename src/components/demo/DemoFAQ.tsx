      question: "Is the demo recorded?",

    },
    {
      question: "What happens after the demo?",
      answer: "Within 24 hours, you'll receive a detailed follow-up email with: (1) Recording of the demo (if requested), (2) Customized proposal, (3) ROI analysis, (4) Implementation timeline, and (5) Next steps."

    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm not technical?",
      answer: "No worries! Our demos are designed for all levels of technical expertise. We'll explain concepts clearly and focus on business outcomes rather than technical details."

      question: "Is there a cost for the demo?",
